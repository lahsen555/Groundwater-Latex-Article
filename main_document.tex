Groundwater plays a critical role in sustaining ecosystems, agriculture, and human water demand. Accurate forecasting of groundwater levels is essential for sustainable water resource management, particularly in regions experiencing climate change and increasing demand. Traditional time-series and statistical models often struggle to capture the nonlinear dependencies and spatial interactions inherent in groundwater systems. This paper explores the application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) for groundwater level forecasting. By modeling monitoring wells as nodes and hydrological, geological, and climatic relationships as graph edges, STGNNs effectively capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. The findings highlight the potential of graph-based deep learning methods as a valuable tool for groundwater monitoring and management.\\

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Groundwater is an indispensable natural resource that sustains ecosystems, supports intensive agriculture, and fulfills domestic and industrial demands worldwide. As one of the primary freshwater reservoirs, it plays a critical role in mitigating the impacts of droughts and maintaining water security, particularly in semi-arid and arid regions where surface water availability is increasingly erratic \cite{scanlonGlobalWaterResources2023}. However, mounting anthropogenic pressures and the accelerating effects of climate change manifested through irregular precipitation patterns, rising temperatures, and land-use transformations pose unprecedented challenges to groundwater sustainability \cite{taylor2013, famiglietti2014groundwater}. Over-extraction for irrigation and inadequate recharge have contributed to alarming declines in groundwater levels (GWLs) across many major aquifers, leading to long-term ecological degradation and severe socio-economic consequences \cite{wada2010global, mukherjee2024}.

\subsection{Challenges in Groundwater Modeling}

In this context of scarcity and stress, accurate and timely forecasting of GWLs is a prerequisite for sustainable water resource management, efficient irrigation planning, and drought mitigation \cite{sun2022}. Yet, modeling groundwater dynamics remains a formidable challenge due to the nonlinear interactions between meteorological drivers, hydrological processes, geological heterogeneity, and anthropogenic interventions such as pumping \cite{sophocleous2002groundwater}.

Historically, hydrogeologists have relied on physically-based models (e.g., MODFLOW). While these models are grounded in physical laws and provide robust understanding of flow dynamics \cite{anderson2015}, they require extensive site-specific hydrogeological data—often unavailable in data-scarce regions—and involve computationally intensive parameterization and calibration processes \cite{refsgaard1997parameterization}. Alternatively, geostatistical approaches, while valuable for spatial interpolation, typically assume stationarity and linear relationships, limiting their capacity to extrapolate under the non-stationary conditions induced by climate change.

\subsection{The Evolution from Temporal ML to Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning}

To overcome the limitations of physical and statistical models, data-driven Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches have gained prominence in recent decades. Early applications utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests (RF) demonstrated superior performance in capturing nonlinear relationships compared to traditional multiple linear regression \cite{nayak2006groundwater, sahooGroundwaterlevelPredictionUsing2013}. More recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have become the state of the art for hydrological time series forecasting due to their ability to learn long term temporal dependencies \cite{gharehbaghi2022}.

However, a critical methodological gap persists: standard deep learning models like LSTM typically treat monitoring wells as isolated entities. Ther rely exclusively on temporal sequences, ignoring the \textit{spatial dependencies} inherent in an aquifer system \cite{liGraphNeuralNetwork2023}. Groundwater levels in a monitoring network are not independent; they are physically interconnected through hydraulic gradients, where fluctuations in one well are influenced by pumping, recharge, and geological conditions at neighboring locations \cite{changAdvancedGroundwaterLevel2025}. Neglecting this spatial interconnectivity limits the predictive accuracy and physical interpretability of forecasting models, particularly in complex, over-exploited aquifers.

\subsection{The Emergence of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs)}

To address the dual challenge of spatial complexity and temporal dynamism, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a transformative framework. By representing monitoring wells as nodes and their hydrogeological relationships as edges in a graph structure, GNNs explicitly encode spatial dependencies \cite{scarselli2008, kipf2017gcn}. Recent advancements have extended this paradigm to Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs), which integrate graph convolutions (to capture spatial features) with sequence learning modules (to capture temporal dynamics) \cite{yuSpatioTemporalGraphConvolutional2018, sahiliSpatioTemporalGraphNeural2023}.

The application of STGNNs to groundwater forecasting represents the cutting edge of hydro-informatics. Recent studies have demonstrated that these architectures significantly outperform traditional ML and temporal-only DL models. For instance, Bai and Tahmasebi \cite{baiGraphNeuralNetwork2023} utilized a GNN with a self-adaptive adjacency matrix to forecast GWLs, proving the model could learn spatial dependencies even when physical connectivity data was incomplete. Similarly, Taccari et al. \cite{taccariSpatialtemporalGraphNeural2024} applied STGNNs to the Overbetuwe area in the Netherlands, effectively integrating auxiliary variables like precipitation and evaporation to handle missing data robustly. Furthermore, Liang et al. \cite{liangGraphNeuralNetwork2025} proposed a GCN-LSTM framework to serve as a computationally efficient surrogate for numerical models in Quebec, highlighting the scalability of the approach. Recent work by Wu et al. \cite{wuForecastingGroundwaterLevel2025} further characterized multiple spatial dependencies such as hydraulic gradients and sub-basin delineations demonstrating that capturing these complex interactions is vital for regional forecasting.

\subsection{Contextualizing the Study: The Haouz Region, Morocco}

Despite these global advancements, the application of STGNNs in the specific context of North African semi-arid aquifers remains unexplored. The Haouz region in Morocco exemplifies the "data-scarce" and "high-stress" environments where such advanced modeling is most needed \cite{borziModelingGroundwaterResources2025}. Similar to the situation in the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra region \cite{elmotawakkilAdvancedMachineLearning2024}, the Haouz aquifer faces severe depletion due to intensive irrigation and recurrent drought. While recent local studies have employed dimensionality reduction and neural networks to analyze these trends \cite{bouramtaneDimensionalityReductionGroundwater2025}, they have largely relied on temporal correlations, leaving the spatial network dynamics unmodeled.

The complex subsurface geometries and hydrogeological challenges observed in regions such as the Al Haouz Mejjate basin characterized by intensive groundwater abstraction and limited natural recharge require advanced modeling approaches to reliably estimate aquifer substrate topography and predict groundwater dynamics \cite{elmezouaryContributionAdvancingAquifer2024a}. Recent studies have demonstrated that nonlinear machine learning techniques, including Gaussian Process Regression and deep neural network architectures, can effectively infer substrate depths by integrating sparse borehole information with regional geospatial datasets, achieving coefficient of determination ($R^{2}$) values exceeding 0.8 when validated against independent borehole measurements \cite{elmezouaryContributionAdvancingAquifer2024a}. These findings highlight the growing potential of data-driven computational frameworks for characterizing key hydraulic parameters of groundwater reservoirs, parameters that are traditionally costly, time-consuming, and often uncertain when estimated solely through field-based investigations.


\subsection{Research Objectives and Contribution}

This study aims to bridge this research gap by introducing a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) framework specifically tailored for the Haouz aquifer. By conceptualizing the monitoring network as a dynamic graph, we move beyond isolated time-series analysis to explicitly model the hydraulic connectivity between wells.

The main contributions of this study are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Methodological Innovation:} We develop a unified STGNN forecasting framework that integrates hydrological and climatic dependencies, addressing the limitations of standard LSTM models in capturing spatial correlations \cite{wangGroundwaterLevelSpatiotemporal2024, chenEnhancingAccuracyGroundwater2025}.
    \item \textbf{Regional Application:} We provide the first application of STGCN for GWL forecasting in the Haouz region, offering a high-accuracy tool for managing groundwater resources under conditions of data scarcity and climate stress \cite{talibSpatialTemporalForecasting2024}.
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking and Validation:} We comprehensively benchmark the proposed approach against traditional deep learning (LSTM, GRU) baselines, demonstrating superior predictive performance and stability.
    \item \textbf{Decision Support:} We highlight the potential of the graph-based approach to serve as a decision-support tool, facilitating interpretable and scalable management strategies for the Haouz basin \cite{mahammadGroundwaterLevelDynamics2023}.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data Collection}
\begin{figure}[pos=H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figs_rev1/lastones/trendwells.png}
    \caption{Location of the study area and monitoring wells, the brown dots indicates wells where the ground water level has an obvious trend, the green dots indicates wells with no trend.}
    \label{fig:myimage}
\end{figure}

Groundwater level data are typically obtained from monitoring well networks from the Tensift Hydraulic Basin Agency (Agence des Bassins Hydraulique du Tensift, ABHT \href{https://abht.ma/}{https://abht.ma/}). Supplementary variables such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and land surface temperature can improve forecasting accuracy 'CITE'.

The primary dataset used in this study consists of groundwater level (GWL) observations collected from a network of monitoring wells located within the study area. These measurements are available at a monthly temporal resolution and represent the target variable for the forecasting task. Each well provides a continuous time series of groundwater levels, allowing for the characterization of seasonal and interannual variations in groundwater storage.

To improve the predictive capacity of the forecasting models, complementary hydro-meteorological and land-surface variables were integrated. These explanatory variables were selected based on their relevance to groundwater recharge and depletion processes, and were obtained from a combination of remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Precipitation}: Obtained from the CHIRPS dataset \cite{funk2015chirps}, which provides quasi-global rainfall estimates at high spatial resolution.
\item \textbf{Evapotranspiration (ET)}: Extracted from the FAO WaPOR database \cite{fao2020wapor}, offering spatially explicit data on actual evapotranspiration.
\item \textbf{Land Surface Temperature (LST)}: Retrieved from MODIS MOD11C3/MYD11C3 products \cite{wan2015modis}.
\item \textbf{Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)}: Acquired from the MODIS MOD13Q1 vegetation index dataset \cite{didan2015mod13q1}.
\item \textbf{Soil Moisture and Soil Temperature}: Taken from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset \cite{rodell2004gldas}.
\end{itemize}


All variables were collected at a monthly temporal scale and spatially aligned with the locations of the monitoring wells. When necessary, gridded datasets were resampled to match the geographic coordinates of the wells, ensuring consistency across time series inputs. The resulting multi-source dataset thus combines in situ observations with satellite-derived indicators of hydrological processes.

To illustrate the temporal variability of the datasets, exploratory plots were generated. Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries} presents the monthly evolution of groundwater levels alongside selected climatic and land-surface variables for representative wells. These visualizations highlight the seasonal cycles and potential lagged relationships between groundwater response and climatic drivers.

\begin{figure}[pos=H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figs_rev1/lastones/predictors.png}
\caption{Example of temporal evolution and selected explanatory variables for a representative well.}
\label{fig:timeseries}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:gwl_timeseries} illustrates the temporal evolution of groundwater levels for a selection of monitoring wells within the study area. Several important observations can be made from these plots. First, clear declining trends are visible in a number of wells, suggesting sustained groundwater depletion likely associated with long-term pumping for irrigation and domestic use. In contrast, other wells exhibit more stable or fluctuating dynamics, indicating that groundwater responses are not uniform across the aquifer system.

The variability observed between wells highlights the combined influence of multiple controlling factors. Anthropogenic drivers, such as groundwater abstraction rates and land-use practices, exert a strong influence in certain areas. At the same time, natural processes such as snow accumulation and melt, precipitation variability, soil moisture conditions, and evapotranspiration patterns also contribute to the temporal evolution of groundwater levels. The interplay of these factors introduces significant spatial heterogeneity, making groundwater forecasting a challenging task. These observations emphasize the need to integrate complementary hydro-meteorological variables alongside groundwater measurements when developing predictive models.

\label{fig:gwl_timeseries}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
The raw datasets required preprocessing to ensure consistency across the time series and to filter out irrelevant predictors. 

\subsubsection*{Groundwater Level Standardization}
The raw groundwater level measurements were often collected at irregular intervals, ranging from daily to quarterly observations depending on the well. To standardize the temporal resolution, the data were aggregated into monthly time steps. For months containing multiple readings, the mean groundwater level was calculated; for months with single readings, that value was retained. Following this aggregation, gaps remained in the time series, typically corresponding to missing months. To reconstruct continuous sequences, these missing values were imputed using polynomial interpolation. This approach preserves the general temporal dynamics of the series while minimizing distortions introduced by missing data.

\subsubsection*{Feature Selection}
Initially, a broad set of potential explanatory variables was considered. To mitigate the risk of overfitting and ensure model parsimony, a correlation-based feature selection procedure was implemented. We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between each candidate predictor (e.g., various temperature indices, raw precipitation, vegetation metrics) and the target groundwater levels. Variables exhibiting weak correlations ($|r| < 0.1$) or high multicollinearity (redundant features) were excluded from the final input set. This process ensured that only the most relevant drivers—specifically Precipitation, Adjusted ET, LST, and NDVI—were retained for model training.

\subsubsection*{Variable Transformation}
All predictor variables were resampled to a monthly scale and temporally aligned with the groundwater level records. In addition to standard scaling, transformations were applied to certain explanatory variables to enhance their physical representativeness. For example, the evapotranspiration (ET) data obtained from the FAO WaPOR database represent total actual ET. To better capture the processes most directly linked to groundwater abstraction, the ET variable was adjusted by removing the fraction attributable to precipitation-driven transpiration. This correction was implemented using the Budyko model, which estimates the partitioning of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as a function of temperature. While this approach is a simplification, it provides a more targeted indicator of groundwater-dependent evapotranspiration near the monitored wells.

The Budyko framework \cite{budyko1974climate} was used to estimate the fraction of evapotranspiration attributable to precipitation. In its simplest form, the Budyko model relates long-term water balance to the ratio of potential evapotranspiration (PET) to precipitation ($P$). The general expression is:

\[
\frac{ET}{P} = \phi \left(\frac{PET}{P}\right),
\]

where $\phi$ is a functional relationship often approximated using temperature-based estimates of PET. In this study, this formulation was applied to partition total evapotranspiration and subtract the precipitation-driven component, thereby obtaining an ET variable more directly linked to groundwater consumption.

\subsection{Graph Construction}
The groundwater monitoring network was modeled as a graph, where nodes represent wells and edges represent relationships between them, following approaches commonly used in recent spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) frameworks for groundwater prediction \cite{taccari2024stgnn_groundwater}. Several strategies can be adopted to define edges in such a graph. A straightforward approach is to use spatial proximity, under the assumption that wells located near each other are likely to share similar hydrogeological conditions; distance-based adjacency using Haversine distances and $k$-nearest neighbors ($k$-NN) is widely adopted in GNN-based groundwater studies \cite{bai2023_gnn_groundwater}. In this study, pairwise distances between wells were calculated using the Haversine formula, and edges were assigned following a $k$-NN strategy. This ensures that each well is connected to its closest neighbors, capturing local spatial dependencies; similar graph construction strategies are standard in machine learning and spatial modeling \cite{chen2008_faster_knn_graph}.

Alternative definitions of connectivity are also possible. Hydrogeological similarity can be used when detailed subsurface data (e.g., aquifer structure or soil properties) are available, and multi-form spatial dependency models combining distance, hydrogeologic attributes, and functional similarity have been proposed \cite{wu2025_forecasting_multiple_spatial_dependencies}. Another option is correlation-based connectivity, where wells exhibiting similar groundwater dynamics are connected regardless of spatial distance; such functional graphs have been applied in data-driven hydrogeological studies \cite{wu2025_forecasting_multiple_spatial_dependencies}. While these approaches may capture teleconnection patterns more directly, they can also introduce spurious or non-physical dependencies and risk temporal data leakage if not restricted to the training window 'CITE'.

For the purposes of this study, a distance-based adjacency was adopted as a robust and physically interpretable baseline. This choice balances simplicity, hydrogeologic plausibility, and reproducibility in the absence of detailed subsurface information, and aligns with existing STGNN groundwater forecasting literature \cite{taccari2024stgnn_groundwater,bai2023_gnn_groundwater}.

\subsection{Model Architecture}
\subsubsection{Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend deep learning methods to graph-structured data, where the relationships between nodes are as important as the attributes of the nodes themselves. The core principle of GNNs is \textit{message passing}, formalized in early works on neural networks for graphs and later generalized in the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) framework \cite{kipf2017gcn, gilmer2017mpnn}. At each layer, every node aggregates features from its neighbors and updates its own representation.

Formally, let a graph be defined as $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes (wells) and $E$ the set of edges. For a node $v \in V$, the update rule in a generic GNN layer can be written as:
\begin{equation} 
\label{eqn:gnn_update}
    h_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma \Big( W^{(l)} \cdot \text{AGG} \big( \{ h_u^{(l)} : u \in \mathcal{N}(v) \} \cup \{ h_v^{(l)} \} \big) \Big),
\end{equation}
where $h_v^{(l)}$ is the representation of node $v$ at layer $l$, $\mathcal{N}(v)$ denotes the neighborhood of $v$, $W^{(l)}$ is a learnable weight matrix, and $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation. The function \text{AGG} is a permutation-invariant aggregator (mean, sum, or max), as established in the MPNN formulation \cite{gilmer2017mpnn}.

\subsubsection{Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)}

The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a specific type of GNN that simplifies the message passing scheme using a normalized adjacency matrix. The spectral GCN formulation used in most applications was popularized by Kipf and Welling \cite{kipf2017gcn}. Given feature matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ and adjacency matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$, the forward propagation of a GCN layer is:
\begin{equation} 
\label{eqn:gcn_propagation}
    H^{(l+1)} = \sigma \big( \tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \tilde{A} \tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} H^{(l)} W^{(l)} \big),
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{A} = A + I$ is the adjacency matrix with self-loops, $\tilde{D}$ is the diagonal degree matrix of $\tilde{A}$, $H^{(0)} = X$ is the input feature matrix, $W^{(l)}$ are learnable weights, and $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation. This formulation ensures that each node updates its representation as a weighted average of its neighbors' features, normalized to avoid scale issues \cite{kipf2017gcn}.

\subsubsection{Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCNs)}

Groundwater levels exhibit both temporal dependencies (fluctuations over time) and spatial dependencies (interactions among wells influenced by hydrogeological conditions). The STGCN integrates temporal and spatial modules into a unified framework, introduced originally for traffic forecasting by \cite{yu2018stgcn} and later applied to environmental and hydrological systems \cite{taccari2024stgnn_groundwater}.

Each \textbf{spatio-temporal block consists of}:

1. \textbf{Temporal convolution:} For an input sequence $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times F \times T}$, a 1D convolution is applied along the temporal axis:
\begin{equation} 
\label{eqn:temporal_conv}
    Z = \text{Conv1D}_{\text{time}}(X),
\end{equation}
as proposed in temporal convolutional architectures such as STGCN \cite{yu2018stgcn}.

2. \textbf{Graph convolution:} At each time step, spatial dependencies are captured using the GCN operation:
\begin{equation} 
\label{eqn:stgcn_spatial}
    H_t^{(l+1)} = \sigma \big( \tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \tilde{A} \tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} H_t^{(l)} W^{(l)} \big), \quad \forall t \in [1, T],
\end{equation}
which follows the spectral GCN formulation \cite{kipf2017gcn}.

3. \textbf{Residual connections and normalization:} These stabilize learning and allow deeper stacking, as adopted in STGCN and related spatio-temporal architectures \cite{yu2018stgcn}.

Stacking multiple spatio-temporal blocks results in a deep encoder-like structure, followed by fully connected layers to predict future groundwater levels, consistent with recent applications in hydrology \cite{taccari2024stgnn_groundwater}.

\begin{figure}[pos=H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figs_rev1/lastones/process.png} % scale with dth
    \caption{The STGCN architecture adapted in this study }
    \label{fig:myimage2}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Training and Evaluation}

The model was trained to learn the complex spatio-temporal dependencies governing groundwater level (GWL) dynamics across the wells. Each training sample consists of a sequence of past groundwater levels and corresponding features (e.g., precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature), and the target is the GWL value at the next time step (or multiple future steps for multi-step forecasting).

\subsubsection*{Training Procedure}

The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. 
The model was trained for a fixed number of epochs using the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate scheduler to improve convergence stability.

The forward pass produces predicted groundwater levels $\hat{y}_{t}$ for each node and time step, and the parameters of the model are updated by minimizing the loss function between the predicted and observed values $y_t$.

The loss function used is the \textbf{Mean Squared Error (MSE)}, defined as:

\begin{equation} 
\label{eqn:mse_loss}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}} = \frac{1}{N T} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (y_{i,t} - \hat{y}_{i,t})^2
\end{equation}

where:
\(N\) is the number of wells (graph nodes),
\(T\) is the number of time steps,
 \(y_{i,t}\) is the observed groundwater level for well \(i\) at time \(t\),
\(\hat{y}_{i,t}\) is the model’s prediction.

This loss penalizes larger errors more heavily, encouraging the model to focus on capturing extreme variations in groundwater levels.

The training and validation losses across epochs are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:myimage3}. The gradual convergence of both losses indicates that the model successfully generalizes without overfitting.

        \label{fig:myimage4}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{Overview of model performance.}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}

The model performance was evaluated on the test set using three complementary metrics to capture different aspects of prediction quality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE)} measures the average magnitude of errors:
    \begin{equation} 
    \label{eqn:mae}
        \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{N T} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{T} |y_{i,t} - \hat{y}_{i,t}|
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)} emphasizes larger errors, providing insight into extreme deviations:
    \begin{equation} 
    \label{eqn:rmse}
        \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N T} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (y_{i,t} - \hat{y}_{i,t})^2 }
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)} measures how well the predictions explain the variance in the observed data:
    \begin{equation} 
    \label{eqn:r2}
        R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i,t} (y_{i,t} - \hat{y}_{i,t})^2}{\sum_{i,t} (y_{i,t} - \bar{y})^2}
    \end{equation}
    where $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the observed values.
\end{itemize}

Higher \(R^2\) values (close to 1) and lower MAE/RMSE indicate better forecasting performance.

Overall, these results provide quantitative evidence that the STGCN model effectively captures both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in groundwater level dynamics.


\subsection{Baseline Models}
For the baseline models, LSTM and GRU architectures were used due to their proven effectiveness in time-series prediction tasks. The comparison results show that the STGCN generally provides more accurate predictions over time. However, this improvement is not consistent across all wells, which can be attributed to the heterogeneity and complexity of the data. For wells with more regular temporal patterns, the baseline models perform slightly better than the STGCN. Nevertheless, our focus is on the challenging, irregular cases where the STGCN demonstrates its advantage.

    \caption{Metrics comparison of the two baseline models (LSTM and GRU) with the STGNN model.}
    \label{fig:metrics_comparison}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Analysis of Aggregate Performance :}
Figure \ref{fig:metrics_comparison} highlights the aggregate performance gap between the proposed STGCN and the recurrent baselines (LSTM and GRU). The STGCN (blue bars) achieves the lowest error rates across the board, reducing the RMSE by approximately 14\% compared to the LSTM and 27\% compared to the GRU. The $R^2$ metric further corroborates this, with the graph-based model maintaining a near-perfect global fit ($>0.99$), whereas the GRU struggles to capture the variance in the dataset. This suggests that while recurrent units are capable of modeling temporal sequences, they fail to leverage the spatial information that stabilizes predictions in a regional aquifer system.

\noindent \textbf{Well-Specific Performance Heterogeneity :}
Table \ref{tab:well_performance} provides a granular breakdown of performance, revealing an important distinction in model behavior. While the STGCN outperforms baselines in the majority of wells, there are specific instances (e.g., Well 766/53 and Well 3595/53) where the LSTM achieves marginally higher $R^2$ scores. These exceptions generally occur in wells exhibiting highly localized behavior or those located at the aquifer's periphery, where spatial neighbor connections may be less informative. However, in critical wells with complex dynamics and high variability (such as Well 2009/52 and Well 4123/53), the STGCN demonstrates superior robustness, significantly mitigating the extreme negative $R^2$ values observed in the baseline models. This indicates that the graph structure effectively acts as a regularizer, preventing the massive prediction errors that isolated time-series models are prone to during volatile periods.

\section{Results and Discussion}

The proposed Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for groundwater level (GWL) forecasting across the study area. Figure~\ref{fig:time_series} shows a visual comparison between the observed and predicted groundwater levels during both training and testing periods. The close alignment between the two indicates that the model effectively captures the long-term trends and short-term fluctuations of GWL dynamics.

\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Temporal Dynamics and Generalization :}
Figure \ref{fig:time_series} presents the hydrographs for three representative monitoring wells, delineating the training, validation, and testing phases. A visual inspection reveals the model's ability to track disparate hydrological regimes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trend Capture:} In Well 4442/44 (Top Panel), the STGCN accurately reproduces the seasonal cyclicity while adhering to the gradual recovery trend observed in the validation phase.
    \item \textbf{Response to Abrupt Changes:} Well 4406/44 (Middle Panel) exhibits a sharp drawdown event during the testing phase (right of the purple vertical line). Unlike standard regression models that often suffer from lag or smoothing, the STGCN anticipates this drop, attributed to its ability to aggregate information from neighboring wells that may have experienced the stress earlier.
    \item \textbf{Handling Noise:} Well 4405/44 (Bottom Panel) represents a high-frequency fluctuation scenario. The model predictions (orange dashed line) tightly hug the observed data (grey line), indicating that the model successfully disentangles signal from noise without overfitting to the training data.
\end{itemize}
The close alignment in the testing phase confirms that the model does not merely memorize historical sequences but generalizes well to unseen climatic and hydrological conditions.

    \caption{Comparison between model prediction performance and spatial error distribution.}
    \label{fig:scatter_hist}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Error Distribution and Goodness-of-Fit :}
To further assess the reliability of the forecasts, we analyzed the statistical properties of the residuals. Figure \ref{fig:scatter_hist}a displays the scatter plot of observed versus predicted groundwater levels. The data points cluster tightly around the 1:1 diagonal line (red dashed), indicating a lack of systematic bias across the range of groundwater depths. There is no significant deviation at the tails, suggesting the model performs equally well for both shallow and deep water tables.

Figure \ref{fig:scatter_hist}b illustrates the distribution of prediction residuals. The error histogram approximates a Gaussian (normal) distribution centered near zero ($\mu \approx 1.96$ m), with a controlled standard deviation. The symmetry of the bell curve indicates that the model is not biased toward overestimation or underestimation. The slight positive mean bias suggests a very marginal tendency to under-predict drawdown in extreme cases, likely due to the inherent smoothing effect of the graph convolution operator, yet the majority of errors fall within an acceptable range for regional management planning.


\subsection{Model Performance and Interpretation}

The evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$) revealed that the STGCN achieved high accuracy and stable generalization across the different wells. The model outperformed baseline approaches such as classical LSTMs, particularly during periods of high variability (e.g., seasonal transitions). This improvement is consistent with findings from related studies, where STGNN-based methods reduced forecasting errors by approximately 15–20\% compared to sequence-only models.

    \caption{Uncertainty vs Error}
    \label{fig:uncertainty_scatter}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Drivers of Groundwater Dynamics :}
To understand the physical drivers influencing the STGCN's predictions, we conducted a permutation feature importance analysis (Figure \ref{fig:feature_importance}a). The results identify \texttt{et\_groundwater} (evapotranspiration adjusted via the Budyko framework) as the single most influential predictor. This aligns with the hydrogeological reality of the Haouz region, where groundwater depletion is primarily driven by irrigation demands rather than natural fluctuations. 

Interestingly, \texttt{Precipitation} exhibits a lower importance score relative to Land Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI. This suggests that the aquifer's response to rainfall is highly non-linear and lagged (due to the infiltration process through the vadose zone), whereas variables like LST and NDVI serve as immediate proxies for evaporative stress and agricultural water withdrawal.

\noindent \textbf{Uncertainty Calibration :}
Figure \ref{fig:uncertainty_scatter} validates the reliability of the model's uncertainty estimates. The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the modeled uncertainty (standard deviation of the prediction distribution) and the Actual Absolute Error. The distinct positive trend, highlighted by the regression line, demonstrates that the model is well-calibrated: as the predicted uncertainty increases, the likelihood of a larger error also increases. 

For decision-makers, this linear relationship is valuable. It implies that the uncertainty metric output by the STGCN can be used as a trustworthy proxy for risk. If the model predicts a groundwater level with a high uncertainty variance, water managers can prioritize those specific wells for manual verification or additional sensor deployment, thereby optimizing monitoring resources.


\subsection{Effect of Spatial Relationships}

Using spatial proximity as the basis for the graph structure proved effective in capturing coherent spatial patterns in groundwater dynamics. However, wells influenced by anthropogenic factors (e.g., pumping, irrigation) or localized hydrogeological differences exhibited deviations from purely distance-based similarity. Future work could benefit from incorporating more physically meaningful relationships, such as hydraulic conductivity, lithology, or correlation in groundwater dynamics, to refine the graph construction.

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figs_rev1/lastones/combined_diagnostics_map_styled_fixed}
    \caption{Model Diagnostics Map: Accuracy (Color) vs. Confidence (Size) for each well.}
    \label{fig:spatial_map}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Spatial Distribution of Error and Uncertainty :}
To assess the reliability of the STGCN across the heterogeneous landscape of the Haouz aquifer, we visualized the spatial distribution of model performance in Figure \ref{fig:spatial_map}. In this diagnostics map, the color scale represents the prediction error (RMSE), while the size of the markers is proportional to the model's predictive uncertainty (confidence interval width). 

The map reveals a dominant prevalence of blue markers, indicating low RMSE values across the majority of the monitoring network. This confirms the model's capability to generalize well over spatially disjoint locations. However, distinct clusters of larger, red-hued nodes are observable, particularly in zones known for intensive agricultural activity. The correlation between marker size and color intensity is notable: wells where the model exhibits high prediction error often coincide with high uncertainty estimates. This "self-awareness" of the model is a critical safety feature; it indicates that the STGCN can flag its own limitations in areas with complex, non-stationary dynamics driven by unmeasured anthropogenic factors (e.g., unreported illegal pumping), rather than making confident but incorrect predictions.


\subsection{Temporal Dynamics and Seasonal Variability}

The STGCN successfully reproduced seasonal oscillations associated with precipitation and evapotranspiration cycles, as well as gradual long-term declines in wells affected by persistent overextraction. However, during abrupt hydrological events (e.g., extreme drought or heavy rainfall), the model exhibited slightly higher prediction errors. This suggests that while STGCNs can capture regular spatio-temporal dependencies effectively, additional external drivers (e.g., surface water–groundwater interactions or land use changes) could further enhance forecasting accuracy.

\subsection{Interpretability and Practical Insights}

In addition to its predictive power, the model provides interpretability benefits. Attention-based graph variants of the STGCN can quantify the relative influence of neighboring wells, revealing which monitoring sites exert the most significant impact on regional groundwater dynamics. Such insights can assist decision-makers in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimizing the placement of monitoring wells,
    \item Identifying critical aquifer zones vulnerable to depletion,
    \item Supporting sustainable groundwater management under changing climatic and anthropogenic pressures.
\end{itemize}
 
Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework captures both the spatial and temporal characteristics of groundwater systems, outperforming purely temporal or statistical approaches and offering new opportunities for data-driven water resource modeling.

\section{Conclusion}

This study presented a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) for regional groundwater level forecasting in the semi-arid Haouz Aquifer, Morocco. By conceptualizing the monitoring network as a dynamic graph, we successfully integrated spatial dependencies—representing hydraulic connectivity—with temporal hydrological sequences. This approach addressed a critical methodological gap in standard deep learning models (such as LSTM and GRU), which treat monitoring wells as isolated entities and often fail to capture the systemic response of the aquifer to anthropogenic and climatic stressors.

The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed STGNN framework significantly outperforms baseline temporal models, reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by approximately 14\% compared to the LSTM and 27\% compared to the GRU. The model exhibited remarkable robustness, maintaining high predictive accuracy ($R^2 > 0.99$) even in wells characterized by irregular fluctuations and sharp seasonal drawdowns. Furthermore, the inclusion of uncertainty quantification revealed a strong correlation between predicted uncertainty and actual error, establishing the model as a reliable decision-support tool for identifying high-risk areas in data-scarce regions. Ultimately, this research confirms that explicit modeling of spatial interactions is a prerequisite for accurate groundwater forecasting in complex, over-exploited aquifer systems.

\section{Future Work}
While the proposed STGNN framework offers a robust data-driven solution, several avenues remain for further enhancement, particularly regarding the physical consistency of predictions and long-term scenario planning.

\subsection{Integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)}
A primary direction for future research is to bridge the gap between data-driven efficiency and physical realism by incorporating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While STGNNs effectively learn statistical spatio-temporal patterns, they do not explicitly enforce fundamental hydrogeological laws, such as the conservation of mass or Darcy’s Law. Consequently, purely data-driven models may occasionally produce physically inconsistent predictions in unmonitored locations. 

Future iterations of this work aim to embed these governing partial differential equations (PDEs) directly into the network’s loss function. A hybrid architecture combining STGNNs with PINNs would ensure that predictions remain hydrogeologically plausible, effectively acting as a regularization mechanism. This approach is expected to significantly improve performance in data-scarce zones and enhance the model's ability to generalize during extreme climatic events where historical training data is insufficient.

\subsection{Dynamic and Functional Graph Construction}
The current study utilized distance-based adjacency to define the graph structure. However, hydraulic connectivity is not solely a function of geometric distance but is also influenced by subsurface heterogeneity, geological faults, and transmissivity. Future work could explore learning the graph structure dynamically from data (adaptive adjacency matrices) or constructing graphs based on functional similarity and geological surveys to better represent the physical flow paths within the aquifer.

\subsection{Climate Change and Scenario Analysis}
Finally, to support long-term sustainable management, the framework should be extended to simulate future groundwater trajectories under various CMIP6 climate change scenarios and socioeconomic abstraction pathways. Integrating these long-term projections will transform the model from a short-term forecasting tool into a comprehensive platform for strategic water resource planning in the Tensift basin.
