Groundwater plays a critical role in sustaining ecosystems, agriculture, and human water demand. Accurate forecasting of groundwater levels is essential for sustainable water resource management, particularly in regions experiencing climate change and increasing demand. Traditional time-series and statistical models often struggle to capture the nonlinear dependencies and spatial interactions inherent in groundwater systems. This paper explores the application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) for groundwater level forecasting.
By modeling monitoring wells as nodes, and node features consist of groundwater level observations combined with relevant climatic variables. Spatial relationships between wells are encoded through edges defined by geographic proximity. STGNNs effectively capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. The findings highlight the potential of graph-based deep learning methods as a valuable tool for groundwater monitoring and management.\\
