	abstract = {Groundwater resources in Morocco often face sustainability challenges due to increased exploitation and climate change. Specifically, the Al-Haouz-Mejjate groundwater in the Marrakesh region is faced with overexploitation and insufficient recharge. However, the complex subsurface geometries hamper hydrogeological modeling, characterization, and effective management. Reliably estimating aquifer substrate topography is critical for groundwater models but is challenged by limited direct measurements. This study develops nonlinear machine learning models to infer substrate depths by fusing sparse borehole logs with regional geospatial data. A Gaussian process regression approach provided robust holistic mapping, leveraging flexibility, and uncertainty quantification. Supplementary neural network architectures focus on isolating specific variable relationships, like surface elevation–substrate. Model accuracy exceeded 0.8 R-squared against validation boreholes. Spatial visualizations confirmed consistency across landscape transects. Elevation and piezometric data proved most predictive, though multivariate inputs were required for the lowest errors. The results highlight the power of statistical learning to extract meaningful patterns from disparate hydrological data. However, model opacity and the need for broader training datasets remain barriers. Overall, the work demonstrates advanced machine learning as a promising avenue for illuminating complex aquifer geometries essential for sustainability. Hybrid approaches that use both data-driven and physics-based methods can help solve long-standing problems with hydrogeological characterization.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal groundwater (GW) forecasting plays an important role in water resources management and planning. Given the increasing anthropogenic and climatic pressures on GW, there is an urgent need for more efficient and accessible forecasting tools to ensure the sustainable management and distribution of this vital resource. Traditional methods, including simple empirical relationships and complex numerical simulations, have shown varying success. However, these approaches often struggle to incorporate new information and are computationally demanding, which can compromise the accuracy and reliability of forecasts over time. To address these limitations, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework that integrates explicit geostatistical methods with implicit machine learning techniques, serving as a surrogate for numerical models to provide fast and accurate GW level forecasts. This GNN framework can be used as a coupling tool with the numerical model to aid in forecasting; it is not limited to surrogacy. GNNs excel in handling complex data structures, making them well suited for geosciences applications. Our framework is trained on simulated transient GW levels and pumping rates generated from a complex hydrogeological model in Quebec, Canada. It has been tested under various pumping scenarios, each taking several days to solve using a dedicated flow simulator. In contrast, our approach delivers results in seconds, offering valuable support for GW management under complex stress conditions. The results highlight the framework’s ability to provide rapid and reliable GW forecasts, offering a computationally efficient alternative for managing GW in intricate hydrogeological settings.},

Regional variations in groundwater levels exhibit a complex spatial dependency structure due to the physical proximity of monitoring wells, hydrological connectivity, and shared environmental characteristics. However, existing research has mostly overlooked the multiple spatial dependencies between monitoring wells, limiting the understanding of the added value that graph-based models bring to groundwater dynamics prediction. In this study, we characterize spatial dependencies of groundwater from multiple perspectives and investigate the impact on the forecasting results of groundwater dynamics using graph-based deep learning. Characterizing spatial dependencies helps improve the understanding of groundwater dynamics, but its effectiveness in enhancing prediction accuracy depends on the characteristics of spatial interactions. Graph neural networks facilitate learning from diverse spatial associations, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of spatial dependencies and uncovering potential connections between monitoring wells. Results based on real data sets contribute to understanding how multiple spatial dependencies influence groundwater level forecasting. Our research provides insights into exploiting potential spatial dependencies in similarly complex and highly interconnected earth systems.},

	abstract = {Monitoring groundwater (GW) level variations, or anomalies in multiple wells, over long periods of time is essential to understanding changes in regional groundwater resource availability. However, it is challenging to predict these GW anomalies over the long term in agricultural areas due to complicated boundary conditions, heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, and groundwater extraction, as well as nonlinear interactions among these factors. To overcome this challenge, we developed an advanced modeling framework based on a recurrent neural network of long short-term memory (LSTM) as an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models. GW anomalies were forecast two months in advance (t + 2) based on the evaluation of drivers that influence GW dynamics in densely irrigated agricultural regions. An application and evaluation of this new approach was conducted in the Wisconsin Central Sands (WCS) region in the U.S., one of the most productive agricultural regions. The modeling framework was developed for the period 1958–2020 by utilizing easily accessible dynamic and static variables to represent hydrometeorological and geological characteristics. GW anomaly observations were acquired from 26 piezometers (wells) installed in the sandy aquifer in WCS over 10–60 years. The subset of GW observations from ∼ 10–60 years, not used in model training, can forecast GW anomalies two months out with a coefficient of determination R2 ∼ 0.8. Additionally, MAE was less than 0.34 m/month across the study region for both temporal and spatial modeling frameworks. Groundwater anomalies showed high spatiotemporal variability, and their responses are influenced differently by boundary conditions, catchment geology, climate, and topography across locations. Sites with higher autocorrelation with previous two-months GW anomalies reduced bias by increasing R2. Land use change and irrigation pumping have interactive effects on GW anomalies forecasting. The novelty of this study is identifying the regional drivers of GW fluxes. This case-specific information and location-related simplification, modification, and assumption of LSTM is a unique contribution to the existing literature. Our framework can be used as an alternative method of simulating water availability and groundwater level changes in areas where subsurface properties are unknown or difficult to determine.},

	abstract = {Groundwater is crucial for food security and economic development, yet it faces growing threats from over-extraction and extreme weather events. The Zhuoshui River alluvial fan, Taiwan’s largest, has long served as a key water source. However, recent climate change and industrial expansion have significantly affected groundwater recharge and quality, contributing to land subsidence. Accurate forecasting of groundwater levels is essential to ensuring environmental sustainability in the region. This study presents a novel hybrid deep learning model, CNN-BP, which integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) to forecast groundwater levels three days in advance at 25 monitoring stations across the Zhuoshui River alluvial fan. The CNN-BP model was benchmarked against a standalone BPNN model. Both models were trained on a dataset of 7,291 daily hydro-geo-meteorological records from 2000 to 2019, including groundwater levels, rainfall, streamflow, temperature, evaporation, and lithology. The study emphasizes comprehensive input selection, feature extraction, and hyperparameter tuning, with Random Forest utilized to filter input factors from 20 rainfall stations, thereby improving forecast accuracy and reliability. The CNN-BP model significantly outperformed the BPNN model, achieving R2 values between 0.94 and 0.98 across various stations and effectively mitigating time-delay issues. The study also explored the relationship between forecast errors and the fan’s lithological characteristics, providing valuable insights for land-use planning and groundwater management. Validation during Typhoons Haitang and Maria further demonstrated the model’s capability to predict groundwater recharge under intense rainfall conditions. By integrating environmental and social factors such as drought frequency, population density, and recharge potential, this study underscores the need for targeted water management strategies. The findings offer critical insights for future regional approaches to groundwater management, promoting sustainable practices across watersheds. Ultimately, this study serves as a valuable resource for informed decision-making in land-use planning and water resource management, advancing the sustainable utilization of groundwater in the Zhuoshui River alluvial fan.},

Study Focus: The research explores Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for optimizing input selection in groundwater level forecasting using neural networks. PCA efficiently reduces input dimensionality while preserving critical information, making it beneficial for neural network modelling of natural systems with extensive input variables in a low-resource scenarios requiring feature engineering. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model predicted groundwater levels in six monitoring bores using four hydro-climatic variables, precipitation, land surface temperature (LST), actual evapotranspiration (AET), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Model performance was compared using two approaches: the LSTM-XGB model with the best-selected input features and the LSTM-PC1 model based on the first principal component (PC1). New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Results showed that NDVI, AET, and LST were the dominant inputs across different monitoring bores. On average, PC1 accounted for 68.3 \% of the variance in hydro-climatic variables, with an eigenvalue of 2.75, surpassing the combined variance of two individual hydro-climatic variables. Both models performed effectively, achieving R² values of 0.982–0.999 during training and 0.885–0.999 during validation. The models successfully captured groundwater fluctuations and the declining trend during drought. LSTM-XGB slightly outperformed LSTM-PC1 in certain cases, but the differences were minimal. The use of PC1 not only mitigates overfitting risks but also allows for generalized predictions across multiple monitoring sites, making it a practical choice for large datasets.},

The Damodar Fan Delta, West Bengal, India.
Study focus
The depletion of groundwater resources worldwide is escalating due to its profuse demand for drinking, irrigation, domestic, and industrial uses. Overexploitation of groundwater in a subtropical fan delta region with rapid population growth like the Damodar Fan Delta in India is of great concern for sustainable mapping, monitoring, and managing water resources. During 2000–2020, the Damodar Fan Delta portrayed an increase in semi-critical community development blocks, implying a decline in groundwater level. To this end, the present study intends to show the groundwater level dynamics including its future prediction, using machine learning algorithms based on the seasonal groundwater level data from 2013‐14 to 2020‐21 for 30 wells.
New hydrological insights for the region
Post-monsoon kharif and rabi depicted a higher fall rate in the groundwater level compared to the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods. Future predictions using the best-fit model indicated an increasing trend in the depth of groundwater levels in the future (2025–26). The extreme gradient boost regressor appeared to be the best model, while the decision tree regressor was the worst performer. The major controlling factors of groundwater level dynamics were decreasing rainfall and increasing groundwater abstraction due to population growth and increased demand for irrigation, domestic, and industrial water.},

	abstract = {Water is a critical resource, but ensuring its availability faces challenges from climate extremes and human intervention. In this Review, we evaluate the current and historical evolution of water resources, considering surface water and groundwater as a single, interconnected resource. Total water storage trends have varied across regions over the past century. Satellite data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) show declining, stable and rising trends in total water storage over the past two decades in various regions globally. Groundwater monitoring provides longer-term context over the past century, showing rising water storage in northwest India, central Pakistan and the northwest United States, and declining water storage in the US High Plains and Central Valley. Climate variability causes some changes in water storage, but human intervention, particularly irrigation, is a major driver. Water-resource resilience can be increased by diversifying management strategies. These approaches include green solutions, such as forest and wetland preservation, and grey solutions, such as increasing supplies (desalination, wastewater reuse), enhancing storage in surface reservoirs and depleted aquifers, and transporting water. A diverse portfolio of these solutions, in tandem with managing groundwater and surface water as a single resource, can address human and ecosystem needs while building a resilient water system.},

MLR and ANN modeling was carried out at 17 sites in Japan, considering all significant inputs: rainfall, ambient temperature, river stage, 11 seasonal dummy variables, and influential lags of rainfall, ambient temperature, river stage and groundwater level. Seventeen site-specific ANN models were developed, using multi-layer feed-forward neural networks trained with Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithms. The performance of the models was evaluated using statistical and graphical indicators. Comparison of the goodness-of-fit statistics of the MLR models with those of the ANN models indicated that there is better agreement between the ANN-predicted groundwater levels and the observed groundwater levels at all the sites, compared to the MLR. This finding was supported by the graphical indicators and the residual analysis. Thus, it is concluded that the ANN technique is superior to the MLR technique in predicting spatio-temporal distribution of groundwater levels in a basin. However, considering the practical advantages of the MLR technique, it is recommended as an alternative and cost-effective groundwater modeling tool.},

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling and understanding data with dependencies to each other such as spatial and temporal dependencies. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data using GNNs. However, the strong interdisciplinary nature of spatiotemporal data has created numerous GNNs variants specifically designed for distinct application domains. Although the techniques are generally applicable across various domains, cross-referencing these methods remains essential yet challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive literature review on GNNs for spatiotemporal data. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of the technologies and applications of GNNs in the spatiotemporal domain. First, the ways of constructing graphs from spatiotemporal data are summarized to help domain experts understand how to generate graphs from various types of spatiotemporal data. Then, a systematic categorization and summary of existing spatiotemporal GNNs are presented to enable domain experts to identify suitable techniques and to support model developers in advancing their research. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of significant applications in the spatiotemporal domain is offered to introduce a broader range of applications to model developers and domain experts, assisting them in exploring potential research topics and enhancing the impact of their work.

	abstract = {Streamflow forecasting over gauged and ungauged basins play a vital role in water resources planning, especially under the changing climate. Increased availability of large sample hydrology data sets, together with recent advances in deep learning techniques, has presented new opportunities to explore temporal and spatial patterns in hydrological signatures for improving streamflow forecasting. The purpose of this study is to adapt and benchmark several state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN) architectures, including ChebNet, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and GraphWaveNet, for end-to-end graph learning. We explicitly represent river basins as nodes in a graph, learn the spatiotemporal nodal dependencies, and then use the learned relations to predict streamflow simultaneously across all nodes in the graph. The efficacy of the developed GNN models is investigated using the Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) data set under two settings, fixed graph topology (transductive learning), and variable graph topology (inductive learning), with the latter applicable to prediction in ungauged basins (PUB). Results indicate that GNNs are generally robust and computationally efficient, achieving similar or better performance than a baseline model trained using the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Further analyses are conducted to interpret the graph learning process at the edge and node levels and to investigate the effect of different model configurations. We conclude that graph learning constitutes a viable machine learning-based method for aggregating spatiotemporal information from a multitude of sources for streamflow forecasting},

In this study, a graph convolutional network (GCN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) (GCN–LSTM) model is introduced for GWL prediction utilizing data from 16 wells located in the northeastern Xiangtan City, China. This model is designed to account for both the hybrid temporal dependencies and spatial autocorrelations among wells. It consists of two parts: the spatial part employs GCNs to extract spatial characteristics from a spatial self-similarity weight matrix and an attribute self-similarity weight matrix among wells; the temporal part utilizes a LSTM module to capture the temporal patterns of GWL sequences, along with monthly precipitation and temperature data. This model dynamically predicts changes in groundwater levels, achieving higher accuracy on average compared to single-well predictions using LSTM. By incorporating both temporal dependencies and spatial autocorrelations, the GCN–LSTM model demonstrated an average improvement in goodness-of-fit of approximately 11.21\% over the LSTM-based model for individual wells. Its application holds significant reference value for the sustainable utilization and development of groundwater resources in Xiangtan City.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of groundwater level (GWL) over a period of time is of great importance for groundwater resources management. Machine learning techniques due to their great performance have recently been used for this problem. Previous methods, however, did not consider the spatial relationships between wells due to the difficulty to handle unstructured well location data. In this paper, a graph neural network (GNN) is used to forecast groundwater dynamics where it can represent each well as a node in the graph. The spatial information is, thus, extracted from an interconnected network using graph convolution layers with a self-adaptive adjacency matrix. The temporal features of the sequence are obtained by gated temporal convolutional networks. The model was applied and evaluated for wells in the southwest area of British Colombia in Canada using data about 11 years (2010–2020). The proposed model performs better in terms of all the defined evaluation metrics, when compared with two baseline models: long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU). Moreover, when the spatial dependencies are completely unknown, the model can still learn them from the data and obtain comparable performance. Furthermore, the proposed model has a high efficiency since it can simultaneously model GWL change for all monitoring wells in the system. We also demonstrated that the spatial dependencies between each well could be intuitively interpreted from the learned adjacency matrix.},

Groundwater level prediction is inherently complex, influenced by various hydrological, meteorological, and anthropogenic factors. Traditional prediction models often struggle with the nonlinearity and non-stationary characteristics of groundwater data. Our study leverages the capabilities of ST-GNNs to address these challenges in the Overbetuwe area, Netherlands. We utilize a comprehensive dataset encompassing 395 groundwater level time series and auxiliary data such as precipitation, evaporation, river stages, and pumping well data. The graph-based framework of our ST-GNN model facilitates the integration of spatial interconnectivity and temporal dynamics, capturing the complex interactions within the groundwater system. Our modified Multivariate Time Graph Neural Network model shows significant improvements over traditional methods, particularly in handling missing data and forecasting future groundwater levels with minimal bias. The model’s performance is rigorously evaluated when trained and applied with both synthetic and measured data, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness in comparison to traditional numerical models in long-term forecasting. The study’s findings highlight the potential of ST-GNNs in environmental modeling, offering a significant step forward in predictive modeling of groundwater levels.},

	abstract = {Groundwater is an increasingly important water supply source globally. Understanding the amount of groundwater used versus the volume available is crucial to evaluate future water availability. We present a groundwater stress assessment to quantify the relationship between groundwater use and availability in the world's 37 largest aquifer systems. We quantify stress according to a ratio of groundwater use to availability, which we call the Renewable Groundwater Stress ratio. The impact of quantifying groundwater use based on nationally reported groundwater withdrawal statistics is compared to a novel approach to quantify use based on remote sensing observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Four characteristic stress regimes are defined: Overstressed, Variable Stress, Human-dominated Stress, and Unstressed. The regimes are a function of the sign of use (positive or negative) and the sign of groundwater availability, defined as mean annual recharge. The ability to mitigate and adapt to stressed conditions, where use exceeds sustainable water availability, is a function of economic capacity and land use patterns. Therefore, we qualitatively explore the relationship between stress and anthropogenic biomes. We find that estimates of groundwater stress based on withdrawal statistics are unable to capture the range of characteristic stress regimes, especially in regions dominated by sparsely populated biome types with limited cropland. GRACE-based estimates of use and stress can holistically quantify the impact of groundwater use on stress, resulting in both greater magnitudes of stress and more variability of stress between regions.},

Calibration and validation using a split-sample procedure were carried out for catchment discharge and piezometric heads at seven selected observation wells. The validated model was then used for two further validation tests. Firstly, model simulations were compared with observations from three additional discharge sites and four additional wells located within the catchment. This internal validation showed significantly poorer results compared to the calibration/validation sites. Secondly, the validated model based on a 500m model grid was used to generate three additional models with 1000m, 2000m and 4000m grids through interpolation of model parameters. The results from the multi-scale validation suggested that a maximum grid size of 1000m should be used for simulations of discharge and ground-water heads, while the results deteriorated with coarser model grids.},

selected through a combination of domain knowledge and statistical analysis of the available data series. Several ANN models
are developed that forecasts the water level of two observation wells. The results suggest that the model predictions are
reasonably accurate as evaluated by various statistical indices. An input sensitivity analysis suggested that exclusion of
antecedent values of the water level time series may not help the model to capture the recharge time for the aquifer and may
result in poorer performance of the models. In general, the results suggest that the ANN models are able to forecast the water

By training a single LSTM model on 531 basins from the CAMELS dataset using meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally, but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-LSTM (EA-LSTM), that allows for learning catchment similarities as a feature layer in a deep learning model. We show that these learned catchment similarities correspond well to what we would expect from prior hydrological understanding.},

	abstract = {In this research, the mean monthly groundwater level with a range of 3.78 m in Qoşaçay plain, Iran, is forecast. Regarding three different layers of gated recurrent unit (GRU) structures and a hybrid of variational mode decomposition with gated recurrent unit (VMD-GRU), deep learning-based neural network models are developed. As the base model for performance comparison, the general single-long short-term memory-layer network model is developed. In all models, the module of sequence-to-one is used because of the lack of meteorological variables recorded in the study area. For modeling, 216 monthly datasets of the mean monthly water table depth of 33 different monitoring piezometers in the period April 2002–March 2020 are utilized. To boost the performance of the models and reduce the overfitting problem, an algorithm tuning process using different types of hyperparameter accompanied by a trial-and-error procedure is applied. Based on performance evaluation metrics, the total learnable parameters value and especially the model grading process, the new double-GRU model coupled with multiplication layer (×) (GRU2× model) is chosen as the best model. Under the optimal hyperparameters, the GRU2× model results in an R2 of 0.86, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.18 m, a corrected Akaike’s information criterion (AICc) of −280.75, a running time for model training of 87 s and a total grade (TG) of 6.21 in the validation stage; and the hybrid VMD-GRU model yields an RMSE of 0.16 m, an R2 of 0.92, an AICc of −310.52, a running time of 185 s and a TG of 3.34.},

In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function tau(G,n) isin IRm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.},

As a result, an estimated 300–500 million people are at risk of severe health impacts and premature mortality. In this Review, we discuss the sources, occurrences and cycling of arsenic, fluoride, selenium and uranium, which are GGCs with widespread distribution and/or high toxicity. The global distribution of GGCs is controlled by basin geology and tectonics, with GGC enrichment in both orogenic systems and cratonic basement rocks. This regional distribution is broadly influenced by climate, geomorphology and hydrogeochemical evolution along groundwater flow paths. GGC distribution is locally heterogeneous and affected by in situ lithology, groundwater flow and water–rock interactions. Local biogeochemical cycling also determines GGC concentrations, as arsenic, selenium and uranium mobilizations are strongly redox-dependent. Increasing groundwater extraction and land-use changes are likely to modify GGC distribution and extent, potentially exacerbating human exposure to GGCs, but the net impact of these activities is unknown. Integration of science, policy, community involvement programmes and technological interventions is needed to manage GGC-enriched groundwater and ensure equitable access to clean water.},

	abstract = {The overexploitation of groundwater resource and its delicacy management has gained increasing attentions in recent years worldwide because of causing a series of serious environmental and geological problems. Currently, accurately predicting the groundwater level (GWL) is an important issue in effective groundwater management across scales. In the present study, three popularly-used data-driven models, which are an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were established in five zones with different hydrogeological properties to explore the model’s accuracy in predicting the GWL at monthly and daily scales in a Northern Plain in China. The developed models were evaluated by both the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results indicate that the performance of the LSTM model is best at monthly time scales with the NSEs greater than 0.76 and RMSEs smaller than 1.15 m in each zone during the training period and demonstrate a good performance at daily time scales with the NSEs greater than 0.9 and the RMSEs smaller than 0.55 m at a local area. Meanwhile, the tempo-spatial distribution of the probability of drawdowns from the LSTM model was estimated by using the object-oriented spatial statistical (O2S2) method. The results show that cumulative drawdowns greater than 10 m are mainly concentrated in water source areas, with probabilities over 0.7 from 2003 to 2010 and declining to less than 0.3 from 2011 to 2014. The GWL rose generally in the study area from 2015 to 2018, but the probability of a drawdown with more than 5 m exceeded 0.8 in Zone V because of continuing groundwater exploitation. This study formulates a framework on developing effective data-driven models for predicting the GWL across scales which have the potential to aid groundwater management.},

A brute-force method to compute the exact kNN graph takes Θ(dn2) time for n data points in the d dimensional Euclidean space. We propose two divide and conquer methods for computing an approximate kNN graph in Θ(dnt) time for high dimensional data (large d). The exponent t ∈ (1,2) is an increasing function of an internal parameter α which governs the size of the common region in the divide step. Experiments show that a high quality graph can usually be obtained with small overlaps, that is, for small values of t. A few of the practical details of the algorithms are as follows. First, the divide step uses an inexpensive Lanczos procedure to perform recursive spectral bisection. After each conquer step, an additional refinement step is performed to improve the accuracy of the graph. Finally, a hash table is used to avoid repeating distance calculations during the divide and conquer process. The combination of these techniques is shown to yield quite effective algorithms for building kNN graphs.},

Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.},

	abstract = {Fu’s equation has been widely adopted to examine the regional (inter-catchment) variability of the water balance at the catchment scale due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the Budyko framework. Fu’s equation has also been used to analyze the temporal (inter-annual) variability of the water balance, but ignoring inter-annual storage changes is a recognized weakness. The regional variability of the water balance was examined through application of Fu’s equation to long-term (1951–2000) observations of climate and runoff in 194 Model Parameter Estimation Experiment catchments across the contiguous United States. A set of hydroclimatic metrics was used to simulate spatial variability in the partitioning of precipitation for the study catchments using the free parameter \$\${\textbackslash}omega\$\$of Fu’s equation. Through the use of a stepwise regression model, it was found that four widely available variables, namely, seasonality of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, seasonal synchronicity between moisture and energy, and the soil moisture storage index, explained 59.2\% of the variability in \$\${\textbackslash}omega\$\$. Application of the empirical formula of \$\${\textbackslash}omega\$\$to Fu’s equation explained 96.5\% of the spatial variability in long-term runoff for an independent set of catchments. To explore the inter-annual variability of the water balance, a modified Fu equation was developed by incorporating inter-annual water storage changes into the estimation of evaporation and total water supply. The time-varying functional forms of the parameter \$\${\textbackslash}omega\$\$, in terms of one or more of the selected environmental factors for each of 194 catchments, were also established at the annual scale. The results indicated that the modified Fu equation with time-varying parameter (MFETP), which accounted for the impacts of inter-annual changes in water storages and the time-variation process of \$\${\textbackslash}omega\$\$, greatly improved estimates of inter-annual variability in the water balance compared to the conventional model. The MFETP offers an improved model for assessment of the inter-annual responses of runoff to changes in climate and watershed properties at the catchment scale.},
